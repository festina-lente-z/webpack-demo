webpack5内部解析了结尾是`ttf`,`woff`,`woff2`的文件（因为内置了file-loader)
```javascript
{
  test: /\.(woff2|woff|ttf)/,
  use: {
    loader: 'file-loader'
  }
}
```
#### webpack guides有详细讲解
Asset Management

#### [Asset Modules](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/)
```javascript
{
  test: /\.(woff|woff2|ttf)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource'
}
```
Asset Modules is a type of module that allows one to use asset files (fonts, icons, etc) without configuring additional loaders.

Prior to webpack 5 it was common to use:
- `raw-loader` to import a file as a string
- `url-loader` to inline a file into the bundle as a data URI
- `file-loader` to emit a file into the output directory
